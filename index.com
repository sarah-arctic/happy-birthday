<h1> HAPPY BIRTHDAY D!! </h1>

<p> Dear Dimi, </p>
<p> I hope you have the greatest day ever and wish you only the best for your Birthday!
I know we haven't known each other for long but the time we have spent talking and laughing together is very dear to me and I simply don't wanna live without that. In these last 2 weeks I got to know you as one of the sweetest, kindest, funniest, goofiest, most positive and most loving person I've ever met. So please, please, please don't ever change yourself for anything or anyone (but yourself). Because this- the way you are, the way you talk, the way you think and the way you present yourself is why I love and care about you so so much. I am endlessly thankful to have a person like you in my life and I hope to keep you in my life for many, many years. </p>

<p> Love, <i> Sarah </i> &hearts; </p>
